<h1>A little bit about me.</h1>
<p>
I’ve conducted various experiments, invented crazy machines, and pursued my scientific ideas. Through the use of garbage and 
scraps, I've created a variety of things, including: robots, rockets, cathode ray tubes, a Marx Generator, 
magnet boots (to walk upside down), a mini pulse jet engine, a 3ft Tesla Coil, etc. These were only made possible 
because of my collection of scientific instruments, ranging from a 3D Printer to an oscilloscope and vacuum pumps. 
For instance, I once replicated the experiment from the movie, "The Martian," where water is produced through the combustion of 
hydrogen.

When I'm not in my lab, I could be found at a local field observing and photographing the wonders of the universe through an
eyepiece late into the night. Or rock climbing/backpacking a mountainside. Currently, I'm pursuing my latest interests 
independently (physics, mathematics, astronomy, computer science, etc). My ambition is to take my knowledge and apply it to 
better the world.
